# getrigged
A website made few years back by me and my friends.

Disclaimer: I am sorry for the headache this project is going to give you, if you decide to make a PR, due to unstructured files and bad code quality of this project (we had just learned PHP)

## About the project
This project was made to practice PHP. It is a website where the user can select various computer parts to create their own PC. Prebuilt options are available too. HTML is included directly in PHP files. Sample database files are in SQL files folder.

Open for PRs.

List of things needed to be done:
1. Arrange files in folders.
2. Delete unnecessary files.
3. Refactor code for anti patterns and bad practices (this is going to take a while).
4. Test application

Start server:
`php -S localhost:5000 -t .`
